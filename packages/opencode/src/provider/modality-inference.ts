/**
 * Input-modality inference for models the user declares themselves.
 *
 * A model configured under `provider.<id>.models.<id>` may say nothing about
 * `modalities`. Something still has to answer "can this model read an image?",
 * because `provider/transform.ts` uses that answer to decide whether to forward
 * an image part or replace it with an error sentence addressed to the model.
 *
 * The answer is resolved in strict precedence order:
 *
 *  1. DECLARED     — the user wrote `modalities` in config. Always authoritative.
 *  2. BUILTIN      — this repo ships the answer for one of its own aliases that
 *                    no catalog documents. See `BUILTIN_INPUT`.
 *  3. PROVIDER-ENTRY — the same-named models.dev provider already lists this
 *                    model id, so its metadata is inherited.
 *  4. DIRECTORY    — the model id alone is looked up across the whole models.dev
 *                    directory and the FIRST-PARTY entry is used. This is the
 *                    tier that a user-invented provider id needs: `mimo-v2.5`
 *                    served through a provider called `mimo` matches nothing in
 *                    tier 3, but the model itself is documented under `xiaomi`.
 *  5. ASSUMED      — nothing is known. This is UNKNOWN, and unknown is not the
 *                    same as unsupported (see `assumedInput` for why unknown
 *                    resolves permissively).
 *
 * Tiers 4 and 5 are the new ones. Before them, an unmatched model fell straight
 * to a hardcoded `false` for every non-text modality, which turned "we never
 * looked this up" into the much stronger claim "we know it cannot do this".
 *
 * Only tiers 1 and 2 are STATED by someone who knows (see `isStated`); the rest
 * are worked out from metadata that may not describe this deployment.

 * Input modalities this repo itself ships the answer for, keyed `providerID/modelID`.

 * `mimo-auto` is a free-tier routing ALIAS rather than a model: no vendor

 * vision-capable model. Its image support is therefore not something to infer —
 * it is a fact this repo owns, and stating it here puts it at the same standing
 * as a user's own `modalities` declaration.
 *
 * It has to enter the pipeline HERE, as part of the verdict, and not be patched
 * onto the finished model afterwards. Assigning `capabilities.input.image = true`
 * after the fact leaves the verdict's own provenance saying `assumed`, and every
 * consumer that asks for EVIDENCE of image support (`Provider.hasEvidencedImageInput`)
 * then reads the alias as unknown and passes over it — which is how the only
 * vision channel a free-tier user has got excluded from automatic vision-model
 * selection while its `input.image` said `true` the whole time.
 *
 * Entries are COMPLETE input maps: an unlisted modality is `false`, not unknown.
 * The permissive `assumed` tier exists for models nobody looked up, which is the
 * opposite of these.
